# Overrides that are applied on a definition with the same
# name below. This happens after $refs are resolved (external
# only!).
# This is only used in model generation.
#
# This is used to set the API uri available to mutate each field
# with the Pulsar API along with its HTTP method, defaulting to
# POST as that is most common.
# If no uri is specified a uri will be automatically constructed
# by converting the field into camelCase, so it's only needed to
# manually set uris where this pattern does not fit.
#
# schema_validation_enforced -> /schemaValidationEnforced
# deduplicationEnabled       -> /deduplicationEnabled
#
# Fields can also be set as immutable to indicate that there is
# no endpoint to change that value and it can only be set during
# initial resource creation.
#
# This whole extra work is only needed when dealing with namespaces
# and topics.
